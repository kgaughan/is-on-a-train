is-on-a-train
=============

This is a stupid twitter hack that monitors a number of different twitter
accounts using the Twitter streaming API and subsequently updates various HTML
files based on patterns in the tweets.

The daemon is based on a hack written for the site `ismulleyonatrain.com
<http://ismulleyonatrain.com/>`_.
