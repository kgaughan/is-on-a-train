This is an example of a site that would run isonatrain.py. Specifically, it's
essentially all the code behind ismulleyonatrain.com.

Copyright on all assets in this example remains with their original creators.

The Iarnród Éireann train image[1] is by Fergal OP[2] and the shot of Damien[3]
is by Andy McMillan[4]. Both are used in accordance with their Creative Comments
licences.

The site uses the excellent Chunk typeface[5] from The League of Moveable
Type[6].

All other site assets are by myself, Keith Gaughan, and copyright is reserved on
them and are provided for demonstration purposes only.
